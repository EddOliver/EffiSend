Welcome, this is our project for Celo’s Mobile online Hackathon.

# Introduction and Problem

Almost 4 years ago Vitalik Buterin, co founder of Ethereum posted in twitter this message:




At that time it grabbed the attention of almost the entire crypto space and the answers regarding that question were mostly a big “Not many if at all”. Of course there have been isolated projects that try to work with the developed world with several big names attached , but not to much avail. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology from that time onwards has mostly been used by a few early adopters and some others, but were mostly already banked, educated people, even in the developing world. 

Now, let’s ask that same question today; How many unbanked have we banked by the year 2021? Despite having made great progress and having outliers like the country of El Salvador, outside of that, the progress is almost null. Most of the same people that are into crypto today have been in for years and are the same elite, educated, previously banked ones, it has not reached those who are not.   

We can say that because our team lives in one of those developing countries that countless projects try to portray as a target for financial inclusion. 

And yes Mexico is the perfect target as it is the largest issuer of remittances from the US and it will break $42Billion this year alone.

Of course, remembering that the US is the biggest sender of remittances in the world.


 

It is important to mention that, according to the World Bank, 65% of Mexican adults do not have any type of bank account and only 10% save through a financial institution, in addition to the fact that 83% of Mexican adults do not have access to electronic payment systems. These circumstances limit the potential of the sector to place the resources of savers in productive projects that generate economic development and well-being for the population. And crypto is not doing better than the legacy system, most of the users are people like our team, tech savvy with a certain degree of education and already banked.

Now let’s review a bit the CELO ecosystem. The concept to reach the unbanked via substituting the crypto address with the phone number is powerful. That has great potential as most of the population here, even unbanked, has a cellphone this number reaching almost 76% of the population.

When we went deeped our research we analyzed  the Valora wallet and application. Despite its great potential and a la Venmo but for crypto transfer capabilities we found great problems with its Cash Out portion. Xbox, Uber, google play and cell phone payments? Sorry for being aggressive, but this does not work for that unbanked population in any way, this is more for the “already banked” elite populace. Most remittances are done electronically yes, but through services like Western union where the families can get cash. This will never talk to them. 

But I think that with certain systems that are already in place and the great potential of CELO we can produce a Dapp that does that cashout part correctly, directed at that populace, and improve on financial inclusion.
